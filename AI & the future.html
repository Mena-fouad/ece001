Many scientific researches say that AI is gateway to the future but many are concerned that it`s not , allow me to explain everything has a bright side and a dark side let`s discuss the bright side first AI has the potential to revolutionize everything from self-driven cars to smart homes and robot even quantum computers furthermore it will greatly improve the medical and scientific fields but many fear that AI may be our doom as human reliance on machines will be so great that if those machines ever malfunction or for some reason stop working it will be a catastrophe and even some think that one day AI will turn on humans like what happens in movies about the future in which machines get so advanced that they think that they need to get rid of mankind to conclude i believe AI is the way we reach the stars but we have to make sure that we know the exact capabilities of those systems and create all the scenarios before rushing in and before we realize what happened its to late to act
